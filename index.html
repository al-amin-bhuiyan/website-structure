                Mountains are very special 
                places. For many, they are
                 sacred; to most, they bring an
                  uplifting of the spirit and 
                  refreshment; to a few, they bring
                  fear. They are the home of many 
                  different people on every continent.
                   They occur in all biogeographical 
                   regions of the world. They are 
                   treasuries of high biodiversity 
                   and rich in endemic species. 
                   Mountains tend to have different 
                   climate conditions and a variety of 
                   geological and physiographic features. They provide magnificent scenery
